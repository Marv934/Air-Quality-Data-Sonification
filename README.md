# Air-Quality-Data-Sonification

Air Qality Data Sonification is a project to make pollution audible.

It makes use of R to scrape Air Pollution Data from [SENSOR.COMMUNITY](https://sensor.community) and SuperCollider to make the data audible.

## Usage

The File *scrape_sensor-community.R* provides two functions to create data sets. It scrapes the data from [archive.sensor.community](https://archive.sensor.community/).

```R
create_set_inherit(id, type, start, end)
create_set_moving_mean(id, type, start, end, dt, tmean)
```

- **id:** Sensor number, eg. *5710*
- **type:** Sensor type, eg *sds011*
- **start** Start timestemp, eg. *2021-09-01 08:00:00*
- **end** End timestemp, eq. *2021-09-01 16:15:31*
- **dt** Timestep (in s) in created Set, eq. *3600*
- **tmean** Time intervall (in s) to calculate moving mean over, eq *60*
